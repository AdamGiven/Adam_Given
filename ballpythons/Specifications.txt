/*
Project Specifications:

This site teaches a little bit about Ball Pythons, their genes, and showcases some of the unique morphs(color patters) they can have.
It also gives a small list of existing morphs and some data on their value and populaterity and allows the user to create a list of their favorites.

All the data is maintained through php mysql scripts by creating the database and database tables, adding and dropping database records.
One table called "members" which holds user account info, one table called "morphs" which holds the names and data associated with the different morphs.
The third table is named using session state information to get the users email and use it to create a table name so that every user can have a 
unique database table to hold their list of favorites.
